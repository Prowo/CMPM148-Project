CMPM 148 Interactive Narrative Game Project with Inky
Game Name: Hollow Plight
By: Steven Au, Ashley Perez, and Will Tate

Organization: We each were in charge of our own case which entails writing, coding, and inky interactions. We worked collaboratively discussing ideas, themes, player mechanics, and experiences. This allowed us to write in the same frame of mind. Steven worked on cleaning up inky code, debugging, and merging each case together. Ashley wrote the ending sequence which is big enough to be its own case.

Experience Goal: We wanted to create a noir style detective game that made good use of storylets while enforcing player affordances. The premise is that you are a veteran detective who has recently experienced a strange sting of cases involving the cult. The player must use finds clues and put together evidence to uncover the mastermind perpetrator causing these deliriouses cases. While working with your colleague, you will see the disconnect with his reality and his twisted interpretation of justice. You can side with him and further understand his reason for his distaste with the city of Dunwich.

The emotional goal is mystery and suspense. The detective game throws the player in a situation where finding information is important to clear the game. We wanted the player to understand the character's emotion, banter and thought process. The goal to emulate a think-speak-act loop in the game so the player can understands the protagonist's thoughts, choices and actions respectively. Giveing them the freedom to traverse the enviroment in any way they saw fit, the player had enough interaction to be immersed while als a bystander.
